# Proprietary Content License

Copyright (C) 2026 Roundtable Labs Pty Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

## Scope

The following content in this repository is **proprietary** and is **NOT** covered by the AGPL-3.0 license that applies to the rest of the codebase:

- Official knight prompts and persona definitions
- Knight seed data in `service/app/data/knight_seeds.py`
- System prompt templates
- Any files explicitly marked as proprietary

## Terms of Use

You may use this proprietary content **only** in conjunction with the Crucible software as distributed by Roundtable Labs Pty Ltd.

### Permitted Uses

- Running the Crucible Community Edition with the included prompts
- Using the knight personas within the Crucible debate engine
- Making minor modifications for personal use within Crucible

### Prohibited Uses

- Extracting prompts for use in other software or services
- Copying or redistributing the prompts separately from Crucible
- Using the prompts to train AI models
- Creating derivative works based on the prompts for use outside Crucible
- Commercial redistribution of the prompts
- Sublicensing or selling access to the prompts

## Why This Restriction?

The knight prompts and personas represent significant intellectual property and creative work by Roundtable Labs. While we want the community to benefit from the Crucible debate engine (licensed under AGPL-3.0), the specific prompts and personas that make our knights unique remain proprietary.

This allows us to:
- Continue investing in prompt development
- Offer differentiated commercial products
- Protect the unique value of the Crucible experience

## Alternative Options

If you wish to use Crucible with your own custom prompts:
- You may create your own knight definitions
- You may modify the seed data structure to use your own prompts
