### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Roundtable Labs and to recipients of software distributed by Roundtable Labs a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Project, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of Your Contributions with the Project to which such Contributions were submitted.

### 4. Dual Licensing

You acknowledge that Roundtable Labs may license the Project (including Your Contributions) under:
- AGPL-3.0 for the community edition

You agree that Your Contributions may be used in both license versions.

### 5. Original Work

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contributions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

### 6. No Warranty

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 7. Employer Rights

If Your Contributions were created in the course of Your employment, You represent that Your employer has authorized You to make such Contributions, or Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions.

### 8. Your Rights

You retain ownership of Your Contributions. You are free to use Your Contributions in any way You choose, including in other projects, provided such use does not conflict with the rights granted to Roundtable Labs under this Agreement.

### 9. Acceptance

You understand that this Agreement is not a transfer of ownership of Your Contributions. You are granting licenses, not assigning copyright. This Agreement does not change Your right to use Your own Contributions for any other purpose.
